## During the Internship, I worked on the following Projects: 

- **Cardiovascular Risk Prediction -** Predicted **CardiovascularRisk** in **Patients** (over **4k**) using **Logistic**, **SVM**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, **Gaussian Naive Bayes**, **KNN**, **Neural Network**, and **MLP** regression ML models with the help of **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Sklearn**, and others

- **Online Retail Customer Segmentation -** Identified major **Customer Segments** on a transnational dataset for a UK-based **Online Retail Store** using **K-means Clustering** and **Agglomerative Clustering** algorithms, applying **Silhouette Score**, **Elbow**, and **DBSCAN** methods with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Sklearn**, and others

- **TED Talk Views Prediction -** Predicted **Views of TED Talks** (over **4k**) using **Linear**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **Ridge**, **Lasso**, and **Elastic Net** regression ML models with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Sklearn**, and others

- **World Bank Global Education Analysis -** Demonstrated different **EdStats Indicators** (over **4k**) of the **World Bank** on **Education System** with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and others
